Elway played college football at Stanford and his entire 16-year professional career with the Denver Broncos. At the time of his retirement in early 1999, Elway recorded the most victories by a starting quarterback and statistically was the second most prolific passer in NFL history. He was also a prolific rusher of the ball, being one of only two players ever to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (the other being Thurman Thomas) and the only quarterback to do so.[1][2",jmanningcongagdo+319@gmail.com,"#N/A","#N/A",Aleen,false,"#N/A","#N/A",Maxy,"#N/A",Denver,USA,"#N/A","#N/A","#N/A",80204,CO,1701 Bryant Street,"#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A","#N/A",(323) 574-0765,"#N/A","#N/A","#N/A",EVP and President of Global Operations,Prodly,"#N/A","#N/A",false,false
